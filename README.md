`chrs` is a (_fast_) command-line client for
[_ChRIS_](https://chrisproject.org/).

> Rewrite it in Rust.

`chrs` succeeds [caw](https://github.com/FNNDSC/caw)

Well, there's hope. Right now, the only thing `chrs` can do is upload files.


## Installation

There are two ways to install `chrs`.

### Download

Pre-compiled binaries are automatically built and uploaded to
[Github Releases](https://github.com/FNNDSC/chrs/releases).
Get the latest version here:

https://github.com/FNNDSC/chrs/releases/latest

This is the easiest installation method, however there is no
mechanism for automatic updates.


### Get from Crates.io

Use [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) to get and build the
package from crates.io:

```shell
cargo install chrs
```

If necessary, add the `bin` folder to `$PATH`:

```shell
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Usage Example

Upload some local files and directories to ChRIS under the path `chrisuser/uploads/my-data`:

```shell
chrs --address http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ \
    --username chrisuser --password chris1234 \
    upload --path "my-data" file1.nii nested/file2.nii folder_of_stuff/
```

Relative path structures are preserved, so the following upload paths will be created:

- `chrisuser/uploads/my-data/file1.nii`
- `chrisuser/uploads/my-data/nested/file2.nii`
- `chrisuser/uploads/my-data/folder_of_stuff/...`

## Known Problems

Relative paths to parent directories, e.g. `../filename`, are not supported.

## TODO

- [ ] fix known problems
- [ ] tests
- [ ] async functions
- [ ] `chrs login`
- [ ] choose between showing progress bar v.s. printing out URLs
