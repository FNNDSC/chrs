This project provides:

- [`chrs`](https://crates.io/crates/chrs), a command-line client for _ChRIS_
  (this is what end-users are looking for)
- [`chris`](https://crates.io/crates/chris), a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) client library for _ChRIS_
  (this is for developers)

## Roadmap

See https://github.com/FNNDSC/chrs/projects/1

> Rewrite it in Rust.

`chrs` succeeds [caw](https://github.com/FNNDSC/caw).
Well, I mean there's hope at least.
Right now, the only thing `chrs` can do is upload files.
