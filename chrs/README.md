`chrs` is a command-line client for
[_ChRIS_](https://chrisproject.org).
It can upload files to _ChRIS_ library, download files from _ChRIS_,
and can run and feeds (computational experiments) on _ChRIS_.

## Installation

There are two ways to install `chrs`.

### Download

Pre-compiled binaries are automatically built and uploaded to
[Github Releases](https://github.com/FNNDSC/chrs/releases).
Get the latest version here:

https://github.com/FNNDSC/chrs/releases/latest

This is the easiest installation method, however there is no
mechanism for automatic updates.


### Get from Crates.io

Use [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) to get and build the
package from crates.io:

```shell
cargo install chrs
```

If necessary, add the `bin` folder to `$PATH`:

```shell
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Using `chrs`

Run `chrs --help` for usage information.

Note: when specifying URLs, they should be to the backend API, not the front-end.
E.g. instead of `https://app.chrisproject.org/feeds/1520`, the correct URL would
be `https://cube.chrisproject.org/api/v1/1520/`.

### Overview

```shell
chrs --address https://cube.chrisproject.org/api/v1/ --username chris --password chris1234 login
chrs upload my_data/
```

### `chrs login`

`chrs login` saves authentication tokens securely using your
[keyring](https://crates.io/crates/keyring). Logging into multiple
different instances of _ChRIS_ is supported, or as different users
on the same _ChRIS_ instance.

```shell
# log in, type username and password interactively
chrs --address https://cube.chrisproject.org/api/v1/ login

# log in without using keyring and non-interactively, useful for automation
chrs --address https://cube.chrisproject.org/api/v1/ --username test-user login --no-keyring <<< "$PASSWORD"
```

### `chrs logout`

Remove previously saved authentication token(s).

```shell
# remove saved logins for cube.chrisproject.org
chrs --address https://cube.chrisproject.org/api/v1/ logout

# remove all saved logins
chrs logout
```
